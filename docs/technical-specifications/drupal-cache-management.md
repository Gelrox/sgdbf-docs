# Drupal cache management

In addition to the built-in Drupal Cache clearing feature, it is possible to clear cache :

- For the front-end independently
- For a specific Agency / a Specific product

This allows Client to clear needed elements only, without having to flush the whole Drupal cache. 
## Drupal Cache clear splitting
From back-office, an option allows to clear the Drupal cache for the front-end part only.

## Drupal cache clear per agency / product

From back-office, a dedicated page allows to clear cache for a specific Agency and a specific Product. The page is composed of 2 auto-complete fields (one field per entity type). As a result, all the data related to the entity which was selected is cleared.
