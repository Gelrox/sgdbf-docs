# **Emails sending management**

From Drupal back-office (Email Settings CP), it is possible to enable /
disable emails sending from Drupal side.

By default, emails sending is enabled, so Contributors must check the
checkbox “Disable email sending” for each email they want to disable. 

**!!** Order confirmation email management is already defined using a
setting in settings.inc.

From this tab, it is possible to enable / disable the sending of next
emails (1 checkbox per email) :

-   VI Part Welcome email sending to the User

-   VI Part Welcome email sending to the Agency / Admin

-   VI Pro Welcome email sending to the User

-   VI Pro Welcome email sending to the Agency / Admin

-   SAP Registration Welcome email

-   Invoice / SMS / Email registration Welcome mail

-   Claims form submission email to User

-   Claims form submission email to email address(es) configured in BO

**!!** Email address validation (using code) step should not be disabled
(no option to disable for those).
