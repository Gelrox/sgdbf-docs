# **Several products with same Product ID**

This section concerns next features on site :

* My Orders detail page
* My Estimates detail page
* My Delivery notes detail page
* My Returns detail page
* My Wishlists detail page

For those pages, in some cases services will return several products which have same product ID. Such products can only be part of the notInPortfolio object. Even if those products have same product ID, they must all be displayed on the page.
