# **Mobile-related pages**

SGDBF mobile applications allows Users to access legal information pages
which are hosted on the websites (so, not managed within mobile
applications, but within websites).

There are 5 pages, with following URLs :

-   /mobile-mentions-legales

-   /mobile-conditions-generales

-   /mobile-cnil-cookie

-   /mobile-regles-confidentialite

-   /mobile-fgaz

Note that those pages donâ€™t have any layout (no header / footer /
templating) - they are just basic HTML pages. For example :
[*https://api.pointp.fr/cedeo/catal/spip/\_AR67/1000000007*](https://api.pointp.fr/cedeo/catal/spip/_AR67/1000000007)

From Drupal back-office, it must be possible to configure each of those
5 pages content, per site.
