<h1>Users</h1>
<h2>Users management</h2>
<p>Users and their related information are sent to Drupal via dedicated services. When user logs in for the first time, it will create a corresponding User entity in Drupal. This User Drupal entity will not store any user information (first name, last name…) except User ID and role provided by service. 
User Drupal entities are used to make sure all Drupal internal session management system / permissions system / related contributed modules work as expected and can be maintained in standard conditions.</p> 
Business roles
This section describes the different roles from a Business perspective. Drupal roles are described in the next section. Each role has its own specificities in terms of management / information display on front-end. There are several layers regarding roles :
Anonymous users
Logged in users
Professional users
Private person users

General statements :

All users can see prices - products and their prices shown depend on selected agency
For each User role, adding products to Cart triggering comes from a dedicated web service

VA (Visiteur Anonyme) : Anonymous User which didn’t select any specific agency. This is the most basic role. For such user, Products catalog shown is the one from Site default agency (since user did not select any specific agency yet). Prices on front-end are displayed with taxes (“TTC” label is used). VA can’t add products to cart (buttons Add to Cart will always redirect to Agencies Landing page).
